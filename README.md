# Wealthsimple Case Study
## Overview and Origin

Wealthsimple was founded in 2014 by Michael Katchen. It is a robo-advising/investment management/Wealthmanager using a passive investment management approach to provide best in class investment services at a discounted price. The founder got the idea for the company after selling his previous startup 1000memories to ancestry.com. His co-founders requested his advice on how to invest their new found funds. He started building a passive/diversified strategy of ETFs and individual stocks and realised that there was a market for a service such as this in the market and decided to found the company with himself and his co-founders the first set of assets under management.

The company initially raised $1.7M from Eric Kirzner, Joe Canavan, and Roger Martin and then a further $50M from Power Financial Corp who now indirectly control 77.4% of the company.

## Business Activities:

There was a gap in the industry for affordable managed investment solutions for investors. Most solutions were too expensive, had account minimums, required speaking to agents, multiple layers of fees. Wealthsimple basically democratized financial investing for the masses. 


Wealthsimple introduced a web based seamless solution with no account minimums, nobel prize winning investment strategy (passive beats active in majority cases) at a flat rate which was cheaper, less risky, than the incumbent players in the market.
The company is targeting two key market demographics:
Individuals who have all their money in chequing accounts mostly millennials
Individuals using incumbents players and paying a very account management/trading fees


According to Stats Canada, Candian households net savings are close to $400B. With Wealthsimple currently having a $5B market share. 

Wealthsimple uses a combination of dynamic languages (Python, PHP, Ruby, etc.), as well as Ruby on rails and NodeJS. They also use SQL and NOSQL to build relational databases.

The company is in the robo advisory space which is a new field of Wealth Management and Investment Management. The field has had a massive growth with multiple competitors exploring the same field with a unique value proposition. Some of their main competitors are NestWealth, BMO SmartFolio and Questrade Portfolios.

Companies in this business are generally judged on Investment under Management. Wealthsimple has had tremendous growth as shown in the table below. With less than $400 million under managagement in 2015 to more than $5 billion under management as of August 2019



##Recommendation
I would recommend that the company introduce a free student service similar to how banks provide a service which allows customers to get familiar and comfortable to a company so that when they start accumulating assets they stay as loyal customers to the company. With 1.34M Canadian in University and more in trade schools this could be an excellent target market for wealthsimple to grow their customer base from 175K customers to the 500K range.
